TRENTINO is a lightweight and modular SOA runtime that is specifically designed for the peculiarities of the embedded domain. It is based on the open 
standard Service Component Architecture (SCA) and enables support for a variety of industrial protocols. Trentino severely reduces 
complexity  and thus has positive implications on both safety and cost during the entire application lifecycle of your product.

The  information business  has  developed  the  service-oriented  paradigm  to  cope  with  flexibility  and  integration  while maintaining short 
time-to-market. Currently, these trends are approaching the lower levels of technology and especially  the  embedded  device  as  the  key  enabler  
of  high-level  technology. The very flexible nature of embedded  SOA architectures offers the opportunity to provide highly adaptable embedded  
systems  with  respect  to  changing  product,  environmental  and  end  user  requirements  in  the embedded  systems  domain.  
<br><br>
TRENTINO  provides  the  foundation  for  cost-competitive,  flexible  and  high  quality service-based solutions for embedded systems by pushing 
successful and proven service-oriented concepts down to the embedded domain and thereby offers a significant benefit for key technology 
providers and end users.
