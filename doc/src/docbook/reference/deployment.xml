<title>Editing sca-contribution.xml before deployment</title>
<para>
In real world applications, the contribution compilation, including validation and code generation often takes place in a non productive system. Many contributions can have common dependencies to a set of libraries. Those shared libraries are typically not in the contribution itself, but are in a separate folder.
To enable Trentino runtime to find external dependencies to a contribution, the user must specify the DLL folder in sca-contribution.xml .
Example:

<programlisting language="xml" >
<![CDATA[
<contribution xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/opencsa/sca/200912" xmlns:ss="MyNamespace">
   <deployable composite="ss:MyComposite"/>
   <import.cpp name="dll-directory" location="../bin" />
</contribution>
]]>
</programlisting>


The tag import.cpp MUST have the name <emphasis role="bold">dll-directory</emphasis>. The required location can be relative to the contribution root folder or absolute.
We recommend using a relative value since it is more portale

<title>Changing dll-directory at install time</title>
<para>
In extreme case, the dll-directory might be different from device to device. The user still have the possibility to set the dll-directory witout having to rebuild the contribution.

In the META-INF directory, open the file sca-contribution.conf and add the following line at the end of the file:

<programlisting language="text" >
<![CDATA[
dir=<absolute/or relative/ path to the/ dll directory >
]]>
</programlisting>
The runtime will not load your contribution if the given directory does not exists.
