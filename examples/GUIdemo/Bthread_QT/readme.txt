This solution buids BThread_QT library used by all GUIDemo contributions. So far it builds for Windows only. For building it uses QT 4.8.x, so it must be installed.
Prior to building set the following environment variables:
QTDIR - points to the QT installation directory, e.g. d:\Qt\4.8.5\
BOOSTDIR - points to the Boost location (the folder containing /include and /lib subfolders)

GeneratedFiles folder contains sources generated by QT tools. Files from the repository potentially can be used to build the library without QT tools, 
although it would require project re-configuration. Otherwise the read-only attribute on those files shall be cleared.

QTLib folder contains pre-built BThread_QT .lib and .dll and accompanying QT .dlls
